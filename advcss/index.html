                <p class="style">The Legend of Zelda is the start of every event that happens in the Zelda series. The game starts with a story from the past, where the Goddess Hylia was in a great war with a demon called Demise. The only way Hylia could save her people was by sending into the sky on a floating island and seal demise into a stone pedastal. Unfortanatly her seal could not last forever so she sacrificed her immortal body to be reencarnated into a mortal body, aswell as set up a massive plan for a future hero to finally deafeat Demise. After thousands of years much knowledge about what is beneath the clouds is lost to the civilazation. It also becomes tradition for the civilization to ride on these birds called Loftwings left by the goddess.</p>

                <p class="style">The game starts with Link waking up to a letter from Zelda making sure he wakes up soon enough for the ceremony that day. A group of knight students have a Loftwing competetion every year to decide which one becomes a knight for the island. After Link wins and the ceromony happens, a dark cloud appears in the sky and sucks down Zelda underneath the clouds. Link is determined to save Zelda and not long after he meets an AI figure could Fi who explains to him that all of this is planned by the goddess Hylia and leads him through his path being the hero in this story. Fi helps Link open up a oppening in the clouds and sets his sight to see the world below for the first time. This is where he meets Impa an old lady who explained even more of what must happen and about demise himself.</p>
