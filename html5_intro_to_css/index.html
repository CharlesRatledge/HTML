            <hr>
            <p>A long time after the events from Ocarina of Time, the entire kingdom of Hyrule was flooded. The cause of the flood was due to the gods of the world, trying to protect all of people from Ganon. This forced every living creature to adapt or evolve by living on small islands all seperated by the great sea. Ganon was trapped under the sea in the remains of Hyrule castle which was given a barrier by the gods so the castle itself would'nt flood. The gods also evolved the Zoras(Fish people) into Ritos(Bird people) so that no one could rescue Ganon from the bottom of the sea. Unfourtanatly Ganon was not held under the sea forever, and reached the surface where he started recking havock. His goal was to find the reancarnated Link and Zelda to obatian their triforces and use it to rule the world.</p>
